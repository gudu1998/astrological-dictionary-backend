INSERT INTO dream_dictionary ("TermName", "Description") VALUES ('abbot, abbess, hermit, monk, nun, or priest', 'To dream of becoming one denotes calmness in passion. Merely to dream of one indicates pride, or malice of which the dreamer will be the victim. The significance of this dream is evidently due to the regard in which the clergy of past ages held their gypsy brethren.');
INSERT INTO dream_dictionary ("TermName", "Description") VALUES ('abduction', 'If the dreamer is the abductor, the dream indicates a desire for power. Individuals who dream of being abducted are probably going through troublesome times and may have a feeling of being carried away by events.');
INSERT INTO dream_dictionary ("TermName", "Description") VALUES ('abortion', 'A dream of abortion dreamt by a man reflects feelings of guilt, not necessarily in connection with parenthood or actual abortion.

INSERT INTO dream_dictionary ("TermName", "Description") VALUES ('abyss', 'If the dream involves feelings of fear, then it probably represents some loss of control, death or failure, or it may symbolize the dreamer''s failure to face up to certain situations. If no fear is present, then a dream of falling into an abyss can represent the potential of going beyond preconceptions and experience. An abyss indicates impending danger, a dream of warning (Artemidorus) or an erotic dream of warning (Freud). This dream may be interpreted as a symptom of vertigo, due to apoplexy, etc.');
INSERT INTO dream_dictionary ("TermName", "Description") VALUES ('acacia flowers', 'A dream of rest and tranquilLity, say the gypsy dreamers.

INSERT INTO dream_dictionary ("TermName", "Description") VALUES ('accident', 'Obviously, such a dream could have a link with a real accident experienced by the dreamer, but if no such experience has taken place, then the dream is probably due to anxiety. A dream of an accident at sea, for example, can signify the end of a long-term relationship and the accompanying feelings of insecurity. If someone dreams of coming to grief in an accident, it may be that he or she is in fact punishing him or herself for something. Dreaming of an accident befalling somebody else may be indicative of negative feelings towards that person. To dream of injuring any part of the body may indicate suffering in that part (Raphael).

INSERT INTO dream_dictionary ("TermName", "Description") VALUES ('actions', 'What one is doing with one''s body in a dream may be significant. Dancing: A dream involving dancing is generally taken to be symbolic of the interaction of people on an emotional or sexual level, even as the precursor to sexual intercourse. It can also reflect feelings of elation, joy, or victory that the dreamer experiences in life. Kneeling: may denote a feeling of humility or even worthlessness on the part of the dreamer. Lying down: may suggest relaxation, passivity, or a denial of responsibilities. Running: may suggest a strong sensation of the life force within, and exuberance.

INSERT INTO dream_dictionary ("TermName", "Description") VALUES ('aggression/hostility', 'To dream of being an aggressor is often a simple expression of anger which the dreamer has been forced to suppress in waking life. It is worth reflecting upon why the dream anger is directed towards a particular person or group of people. A woman who dreams of an aggressive man may have a deep-seated fear of sexual assault, while an aggressive woman in a man''s dream may, in reality, be a symbol for the unresolved fear of his mother.');

INSERT INTO dream_dictionary ("TermName", "Description") VALUES ('axe', 'To see an axe in a dream denotes death. Freud designates this as an erotic dream, although the interpretation is rather hazy.

In modern times, however, its symbolism altered, and it became a crudely murderous weapon.');
INSERT INTO dream_dictionary ("TermName", "Description") VALUES ('baby', 'Babies appear quite frequently in dreams. A crying baby is generally thought to represent illness of some kind. Babies also represent one''s responsibilities. Dreaming of looking after a baby and something dreadful happening to it can mean that you are frightened of making a mess of things.

Consequently, humans have imposed upon themselves certain restraints concerning sexual behavior. These restraints are not universally the same, and it is true to say that for many people, their conditioning concerning sexual behavior through family, religious authority, etc., may be completely at odds with their desires. Thus, sexual desires have to be sublimated in waking life. The dream world is a safe place for the dreamer to explore feelings that he or she may feel prevented from expressing in waking life. Thus it can act as a release for sexual tension. Dreams of sex, or dreams in which sexual symbols occur (and there are many), can, if interpreted properly, offer considerable insight to the dreamer. It must be added, however, that overtly sexual dreams can disturb some people and fill them with such feelings of guilt and revulsion that they try to sublimate the dreams themselves, instead of using the dream as a simple release or tool for building greater self-awareness.');
